## What is regression?

Suppose we have a scatterplot of two variables, $x$ and $y$.

## What is regression?

Now suppose we fit a line to these data.

What makes one line better than another?

## How far is apoint from the line?

If we want to measure the distance away from each line, we can take the y and x distance from each line. 

## The linear regression model

- The simple linear regression model is:

$$Y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X + \varepsilon$$

where $\varepsilon \sim N(0, \sigma^2_\varepsilon)$. 

- The equation of a fitted line:

$$\hat{y}_i = \hat{\beta}_0 + \hat{\beta}_1 x_i$$

- The Sum of Squared Errors (SSE) is a loss function that defines how poorly our line fits:

$SSE = \sum_{i=1}^N(y_i - \hat{y_i})^2$

$SSE = \sum_{i=1}^N(y_i - (\hat{\beta}_0 + \hat{\beta}_1 x_i))^2$

- This is called Ordinary Least Squares, or OLS for short. 

## Detour: Calculus

- Recall from calculus learning about finding the derivative. 
- You may have started by calculating the slope of a straight line using the slope formula. 
- But what about the slope of a curved line at any given point?

## Detour: Calculus

- In order to find the slope of a line at any given point, we would need to find the derivative.

  Recall: If $y = cx^p$, then $\frac{dy}{dx} = cpx^{(p-1)}$
  
$y = 15-7.2x + x^2$
$y = 15x^0 - 7.2x^1 + 1x^2$

$\frac{dy}{dx}= 15\cdot 0 \cdot x^{(0-1)} - 7.2 \cdot 1 \cdot x^{(1-1)} + 1 \cdot 2 \cdot x^{(2-1)}$

## Comprehension questions for self-study

- Is the fitted OLS regression line the line that is closest to all the data? In what sense?

- How would you choose whether to use Pearson's correlation or regression for two variables? If you choose the latter, how would you choose which variable to be Y?
