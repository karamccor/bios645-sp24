## How would you summarize a set of data?

- List the values
- Refer to a known distribution

### Distribution (put loosely):

A mathematical rule that describes the relative frequency of different events.

(e.g., normal, uniform, Bernoulli, binomial, Poisson, etc.)

- The following is a probability density function (pdf) of a random variable $Y$ that is normally distributed with mean $\mu$ and variance $\sigma^2$. 

$$Y = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi\sigma^2}}\text{exp}\left[-\frac{1}{2}\frac{(X-\mu)^2}{\sigma^2}\right]$$
