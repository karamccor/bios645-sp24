## How would you summarize a set of data?

- List the values, find a min/max, range, find the average
- Refer to a known distribution

### Distribution (put loosely):

A mathematical rule that describes the relative frequency of different events.

(e.g., normal, uniform, Bernoulli, binomial, Poisson, etc.)

- For example, a normal distribution:

$$f(x) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi\sigma^2}}\text{exp}\left[-\frac{1}{2}\frac{(x-\mu)^2}{\sigma^2}\right]$$

## For example

$$f(x) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi\sigma^2}}\text{exp}\left[-\frac{1}{2}\frac{(x-\mu)^2}{\sigma^2}\right]$$

- We could calculate an average of all values: $\bar{x} = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^n x_i}{N}$

- We could calculate a sample variance of the values: $s^2 = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^N(x_i - \bar{x})^2}{(N-1)}$

## How should we think about $\mu$ and $\bar{x}$?

- What is a variable?
- Recall from past math courses: 7 + x = 10

### Variable vs. unknown constant (loosely):

A variable is a number you can move around, not just a number whose value you don't know. 

## Random variable

- What is a random variable?

**Random variables vs. realized values (loosely):**

A random variable is a number that moves around according to a probability distribution. A realized value is just a number, although it may have come from a probabilistic process.

## Distributions can refer to different sets of entities

- Sample (e.g. the people in your study)
- Population (e.g. all of humanity)

**The Big Question**

- Why is it possible to use what we've discovered about a sample distribution to say something about the population distribution? (And how would we go about this?)
